Your final grade is based on seven programming assignments each worth 5% (not including Program #0) and three exams.  Your highest two exam scores will each contribute 25% to your final grade; your lowest exam score will contribute 15%.  You must complete and hand in <EM>all</EM> the assignments to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course.  Final grades for all CS 302 sections are graded on a curve with a mean in the range of 2.8 - 3.0, where A = 4.0; the curve is computed after the final exam is completed.<P>

The following topics and sections of the text will be approximately covered each week during the semester.  You will only get the most out of this class if you read the relevant sections of the text <EM>before</EM> coming to class.  This way you will be able to ask questions in class about anything that you are unsure of, instead of waiting until you're in the lab trying to work on an assignment to discover you didn't really understand something.<P>

<H2><A HREF="#menu" NAME="assignments"><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15></A> Exams and Programming Assignments</H2>

There are three exams: two mid-term exams and one final exam.  Exams constitute 65% of your final grade so it is very important to do well on them to ensure a good grade, regardless of your performance on the assignments.  All exams are approximately two hours long (though you may stay a bit longer if you need extra time) and are closed-book.  You only need to bring a pen or pencil to exams - calculators are not necessary or even useful.

There are seven programming assignments (not including Program #0) each contributing 5% to your final grade.  All the assignments must be completed and handed in to be eligible to receive a passing grade for the course.  You <STRONG>must</STRONG> attempt to complete every programming assignment.  If you hand in a program that does not run or will not even compile without errors then it will <STRONG>not</STRONG> be graded and will automatically receive a <STRONG>zero</STRONG> grade and you risk failing the course.<P>

<H3>How to Get Help with Your Assignments:</H3>
<DL>
   <DT>Consultants: 
   <DD>The consultants in the computer lab can help you with most problems.  They wear name tags and are on duty from approximately 8:00 am to 11:00 pm.  Consultants can answer short questions about compiler error messages and program syntax, as well as how to login, use the printers, send E-mail, run Netscape, etc.<P>

   <P>
   
   <DT>Instructor:
   <DD>General questions about an assignment or questions that may require a long explanation are best answered by myself.  Please see me during office hours or send me E-mail.  I am not normally in my office except during office hours because I do my dissertation research from home via a modem.  Therefore, if you want to see me outside of office hours please make an appointment first.  You can most easily contact me by E-mail because I regularly login and read my E-mail from home.<P>

<H2><A HREF="#menu" NAME="problems"><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bestor/icons/arrowleft.gif" WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=15></A> Problem Solving Exercises</H2>

One of the most important skills you will learn in this class is <EM>problem solving</EM>.  Good problem solving skills distinguish a "good" computer programmer from a "bad" one - it doesn't matter how familiar or skilled you are in a particular programming language, if you do not understand how to solve the problem then you will not be able to write a computer program for it in <EM>any</EM> language.<P>

To help you learn problem solving skills and techniques I will assign weekly problem solving exercises.  These will be small but non-trivial problems which I will give out each Monday.  You should look at the problem and think about it during the week and right down the steps you would go through to solve the problem; i.e. the overall structure of your program.  This is primarily an exercise in general problem solving so you do <STRONG>not</STRONG> have to write any FORTRAN code (though you may if you want to and have time) and your solution/algorithm should not even be dependent on a particular programming language such as FORTRAN.  Each Friday we will go over the solution in class.<P>

You will be using the <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/Labs/1350.html">Vectra lab</A> in Rm. 1350 Computer Science & Statistics containing Hewlett-Packard Vectra's running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft FORTRAN.  This lab is open from 7:00 am to 1:00 am seven days a week except certain holidays.  The printer room is located across the hall in Rm. 1359.<P>

You may also use your home or dorm computers to write your programs, however you will probably have to purchase your own copy of Microsoft FORTRAN or Lahey Personal FORTRAN (see the inside cover of the textbook).  You may also work in any of the other computer labs on campus, however most do not have FORTRAN compilers (please see me first before using the <A
