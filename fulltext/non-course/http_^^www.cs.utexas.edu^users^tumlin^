<h2> Research </h2>

I am interested in issues of security in distributed systems.  At present I
am studying formalisms (e.g. BAN logic) for developing and analyzing authentication
protocols.<br>
<br>
I have done some work in the use of formal methods for synthesis, 
specification and verification of parallel and distributed systems.  I am
working on a paper on the synthesis of resource controllers that communicate
with their clients by means of queued messages.  (For a draft of this paper,
see <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tumlin/mpcs.ps">"Synthesis of Distributed Control Systems"</a>.)<br>
<br>
In addition, I am a student research assistant at <a href="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu">Applied Research Laboratories</a>.  I am currently working a project to investigate using evolutionary computation techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms) to develop finite state machines.  For more information on this project, click <a href="http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/~epierce/genetic.html">here</a>.<br>

My resume is available here in both <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tumlin/res.html">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/tumlin/resume.ps">PostScript</a> formats. <br>
