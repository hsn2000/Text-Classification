Horus, the son of Isis and of Osiris, was a god whose attributes appealed
strongly to the Egyptians from one end of Egypt to the other, because
in him every man and woman saw the type of what he or she wished to possess,
that is to say, renewed life, and life as opposed to death, and movement
as opposed to inactivity.

<!-- some paragraphs on the goals and status of the project --> 

Horus provides a framework for the development of distributed applications
based on <EM>group communications</EM>, a style of computing that can arise in
fault-tolerant systems, managed distributed systems, applications that
exploit data replication or coherent caching, and groupware. Within the
overall Horus framework a large collection of system and application
protocols have been developed that allow the application designer to
construct a communication module that exactly meets the application
requirements at minimal cost. 
<P>
The Horus project was originally launched as an effort to redesign  the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/ISIS">Isis</A> group
communication system, but has evolved into a general purpose communication
architecture with advanced support for the development of robust
distributed systems in settings for which Isis was unsuitable, such as
applications that have special security or real-time requirements. Besides
the practical uses of our software, the project has contributed 
towards the theory of <EM>virtually synchrony</EM>, a runtime model used
for our implementation of data replication and fault-tolerance.   At the same
time, our software is much faster and lighter weight than the Isis system.
<P>
Horus exists as two systems: an initial version coded in C, which can be
used for research purposes at no fee but has restricted commerical
rights,
and a new version called Ensemble, written in ML but usable from many
other languages, which  is available for all classes of users at no
fee.  Ensemble is actively under development and we will do series of
releases over the fall of 1996 and spring of 1997.  By early in
1997, Ensemble
will be an outstanding environment for building Java-based groupware
applications that do multimedia conferencing on the Web.
<P>
Horus and Ensemble are designed to be platform independent, and are
available for different
classes of workstations, personal computers, parallel processors and on
next-generation cluster environments using standard high-speed
communications networks. 
<P>
The Horus effort collaborates closely with many other distributed systems
projects, including Transis, NavTech, and the StormCast and TACOMA
projects. Links to these and other projects can be found elsewhere in these
pages.

<EM>
Of the circumstances under which Horus was begotten we gain a good idea from
a hym to Osiris in which the sorrow of his mother Isis at the death of her
husband is described. The goddess was greatly distressed, but she was equipped
with mighty words of power, and she knew how to utter them so that they might
have the greatest effect, and she set out in search of the dead body of osiris 
and never rested until she had found him. With her hair she made light, and 
with her wings she stirred the air as she made lamentation for her brother 
Osiris, and at length she brought his body into a state of activity, and 
was them united to him; thus she became with child by him, and her son Horus 
was born in a secret place where she suckled him and reared him.
