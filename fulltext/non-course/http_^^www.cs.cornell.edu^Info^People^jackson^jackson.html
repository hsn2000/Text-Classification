<h2>Research Interests</h2>
Theorem proving environments, formal methods for software and
hardware development, computer algebra, synthesis of scientific programs,
linkage of software tools for engineering design.

<h2>Nuprl</h2>
The Nuprl project has its own 
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/NuPrl/nuprl.html">
World-Wide Web home page </a>. From here, you can access documentation on 
Nuprl and communicate with a live Nuprl session that has some basic 
theories loaded. This collection of Nuprl pages still needs further work
on it to make it more accessible. I or someone else will get
round to paying some attention to this, sometime in the next month or two.
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/jackson/nuprl/index.html"> Hypertext listings </a> for most of the
theories I developed for my thesis are available.  The listings for
each theory include introductions, summaries of definitions and
theorems, and formatted proofs. The listings for the
polynomial-related theories are not included at the moment, but should
be in the next couple of days.
