<H1>UW Cecil/Vortex Project</H1>

Welcome to the home page for the Cecil and Vortex projects at <A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">UW CSE</A>.  We conduct research on programming language design and implementation, with an emphasis on these issues for object-oriented languages.<P>

<B>Cecil</B> is a purely object-oriented language intended to support rapid
construction of high-quality, extensible software.  Cecil incorporates
multi-methods, a simple prototype-based object model, a mechanism to
support a structured form of computed inheritance, module-based
encapsulation, and a flexible static type system which allows
statically- and dynamically-typed code to mix freely.

<p>

<B>Vortex</B> is an optimizing compiler infrastructure for
object-oriented and other high-level languages.  It targets both pure
object-oriented languages like Cecil and hybrid object-oriented
languages like C++, Modula-3, and Java.  Vortex currently incorporates
high-level optimizations such as static class analysis, class hierachy
analysis, profile-guided receiver class prediction, profile-guided
selective procedure specialization, intraprocedural message splitting,
automatic inlining, and static closure analyses.  It also includes a
collection of standard intraprocedural analyses such as common
subexpression elimination and dead assignment elimination.  The Vortex
compiler is written entirely in Cecil.

<P>

An initial beta release of the Cecil/Vortex system is currently
available for SPARCs running either SunOS 4 or SunOS 5 (Solaris).

We've recently finished a <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/Papers/whole-program.html">technical report</a> that describes much of our implementation research.
