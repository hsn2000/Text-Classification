be taken as representing the official position of the University of

web page on a government-owned computer should not be taken as an
indication that I endorse everything that the government does.)

<h3>Formal methods have always been risky to use</h3>


``Peano was one of the first to use what we now call symbolic logic.
He introduced, for instance, the use of the symbols `(E x)' to mean
`there is an x such that'; and he habitually wrote out all of his
lecture notes in his new symbolism.  He was teaching at a military
academy at the time, and his students were so incensed by his
formalistic approach to mathematics that they rebelled (despite his
promises to pass them all) and got him fired.  Subsequently he found a
more congenial setting at the University of Turin.'' -- <em> Gödel's
Incompleteness Theorems</em>, Rudy Rucker, p. 289.

<h3>The Death of Fundamental Science?</h3>


"`Fundamental science is on the verge of extinction.' said Harold W.
Kroto of Britain's Sussex University, who shared the 1996 chemistry
prize with Robert F. Curl and Richard E. Smalley of Rice University in
Houston, for their discovery of carbon atoms bound in the shape of a
soccer ball." -- From the article "Scientists lament loss of funding,"
Associated Press, December 10, 1996, <em><a
href="http://stumedia.tsp.utexas.edu/webtexan">Daily Texan</a></em>.
