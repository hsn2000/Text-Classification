I am usually available in my office, but the best way to reach me is
<a href="mailto:svkakkad@cs.utexas.edu">via email</a>.  Here's my <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/cgi/finger/svkakkad">full finger information</a>.<p>

<h2>Research Information</h2>

I am a member of the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/"> OOPS Research Group</a> in
the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/svkakkad//"> Department of Computer Sciences</a> at 
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a>.
<p>

As part of my Ph.D. research, I have implemented a persistent storage
system, called <b>Texas</b>, for C++. It provides easy persistence,
while using a novel technique called "pointer swizzling at page fault
time" to efficiently support large addresses on standard hardware.<p>

For more information, please see the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/svkakkad/papers.html">list of my
publications</a> (along with brief descriptions). <p>

I plan to graduate with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in May 1996. My
resume is available in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/svkakkad/resume.ps">Postscript</a>. <p>

I am currently working at Motorola at Somerset Design Center, while
finishing up my Ph.D. in Computer Science.
