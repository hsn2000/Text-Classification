Research activities of the laboratory span the entire development cycle of 
network protocols, from design and specification, to verification, testing, 
performance analysis, implementation, and performance tuning.  Of current
interest are new architectures and protocols that address changes in underlying 
communications technology as well as in networked applications. <p>

Laboratory research projects are supervised by
