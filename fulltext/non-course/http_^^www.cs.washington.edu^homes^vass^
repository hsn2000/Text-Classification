Hello.  To start with, I am not really a web person.  The best link
I've come up with thus far is this: <a href=>http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/very useful documents</a>
(it's also the shortest to write :).  <!--Nonetheless, I've already got an
<a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/advice.html advice</a for ya.><P>

When WWW was young, I collected quite a few links and downloaded a few
files.  I have been expanding my collection since then.  All this
stuff is here:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Links/exclusive.html><b>selected links and quotes</b></a>
<li><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Links/russians.html><b>Russian home pages</b></a>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Links/main.html">various links</a>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Guides/guides.html">guides to HTML and forms</a>
</ul><P>

Recently I joined the <a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/>UW Cecil
project</a>.  Cecil is a cool pure object-oriented language and
Vortex is an even cooler compiler infrastructure.  We will be
faster than C!  (maybe...)  Here are <a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/Papers/papers.html>papers we have written</a>. <P>

As a member of the CS Lab staff, I designed and implemented the
<a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/MVis/><em>MVis</em></a> system -- WWW-assisted access to our
departmental room and visitor database.  (Recently it has been
upgraded by other staff people.)<P>

My quals project was expanding the
<a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/>ZPL language</a>
to handle irregular data structures (represented by graphs) and
dynamically repartitioned data (both graphs and arrays).

Here is my
<a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Links/GraphZPL-paper.ps>quals writeup</a> (329K, 47 pages).
For a short overview, check out the
<a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Links/GraphZPL-slides.ps>slides</a>
from my presentation (29 pages/slides).

Also, I have collected a few <a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/Links/z.html>links</a> to
resources related to the project. <P>
