<b>Ed Lazowska</b> is Professor and Chair of the
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/index.html">
Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.washington.edu">
University of Washington</a>.

<p>
Lazowska received his A.B. from <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu">
Brown University</a> in 1972, and has been at the University
of Washington since receiving his Ph.D. from the
<a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca">
University of Toronto</a> in 1977.
His research concerns computer systems and computer system
performance.  Recent specific topics have included parallel
discrete-event simulation, scheduling policies for multiprocessors,
kernel structures to support high-performance parallel computing,
programming systems for networks of multiprocessors, effective
program performance monitoring tools for parallel systems, the
interaction of architecture and operating system design, hardware
and software techniques for high performance communication, and,
most recently, operating system and programming system support that
exploits wide-address architectures
