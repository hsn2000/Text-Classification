<h2> Research Areas </h2>

<ul>

<li> Memory hierarchies, especially persistent object stores,
distributed virtual memories, and caches.  We have developed a simple,
high-performance persistent store for C++, called <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#texas"> Texas</a>, which uses <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#swizz"> pointer swizzling at page fault time</a> to
implement large address spaces efficiently on stock hardware and
operating systems, using standard compilers.

<li> Basic studies of program behavior and memory allocation, which
attempt to repair the damage done by three decades of mostly unsound
studies of memory allocation.  (See our extensive
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#allocsrv"> allocator survey </a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#neely-thesis"> (NEW!) Mike Neely's masters thesis.</a>)

<li> Automatic storage management, especially real-time, generational
and distributed.  See Wilson's <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#bigsurv">
large</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#gcsurvey"> small</a> surveys on
garbage collection</a>, and papers on efficiency and 
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#caching-gen-gc"> locality</a> of garbage collectors.
We have recently developed a hard <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#real-time-gc">
real-time garbage collector</a> (written in C++) which we use with C++
(via a "smart pointer" interface) and our object-oriented Scheme.

<li> <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html#prefetchsim"> Adaptive memory management</a>
for virtual memory and file systems, especially dynamic grouping and
compression in log-structured file systems, and checkpointing for
fault tolerance and time-travel debugging.

<li> Implementation of highly extensible and portable programming
systems, including our new object-oriented extended Scheme system, RScheme,
which has threads, sockets, real-time GC, a TK interface, etc.  See
<a href="http://www.rosette.com/~donovan/"> Donovan Kolbly</a>'s home
page for more info, alpha release source code, etc.  Paul Wilson's
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/schnotes"> course notes
on Scheme</a>, Scheme interpretation and compilation (in raw
ASCII text), and
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/schnotes/rscheme.txt">RScheme</a>
are also available via ftp.

For a description our integrated macro-processing algorithm to
support extensible languages and open compilers, see
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/carl-msthesis.ps"> (NEW!)
Stephen Carl's masters thesis</a> (Note: this thesis
contains references to a couple of new papers we're writing which
aren't available yet, but will be (in draft form anyway) sometime
soon.) </ul>

Also online is a draft of most of Paul Wilson's book-in-progress,
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/cs345/schintro-v11/schintro_toc.html"> (NEW!) An Introduction to Scheme and its Implementation </a> in html
format for web browsing.  This contains most (but not all) of the material
from the ASCII course notes on Scheme, in a much improved and expanded
presentation.  (It's about 300 standard texinfo pages so far.  More material
is in the works, including an intro to object systems and metaobjects.)
Besides being a good general introduction to the Scheme 
language, Scheme programming, and interpreters and compilers, it provides
a general introduction to things like macros---making it good background
reading for Stephen Carl's masters thesis.
<p>

A <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/papers.html">list of our papers</a>, with brief descriptions,
is also available.
<p>

More papers, a bibliography on heap management, and the <a
href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/texas/"> source code for
Texas Persistent Store</a> are available via anonymous ftp at <a
href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage">
<b>ftp.cs.utexas.edu:/pub/garbage</b></a>. The 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/README"> README</a> 
file lists all the available material including subdirectories which
contain collected papers from the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/GC91">1991</a> and 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/GC93">1993</a> OOPSLA 
Garbage Collection and Memory Management Workshops.

<p>

People interested in garbage collection may also be interested in
<a href="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/hb/hbaker/home.html"> Henry Baker's
ftp site</a>, although it's on an overloaded site and may not
be accessible (keep trying).  Another site of great interest is
<a href="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/gc"> Hans Boehm's</a> which
contains several papers as well as free source code for several
garbage collectors used with C, C++ and other languages.
