      Software is playing an increasingly important role in systems such
      as nuclear reactors, aircraft, defence and space systems, chemical
      plants, and medical equipment.  Because of the consequences of a
      malfunction, these safety-critical systems must pass rigorous tests
      and reviews before they may be used.  Although system safety engineering
      techniques have existed for decades, most do not apply to systems that
      contain digital computers and software. <p>
<P>
      The goal of the University of Washington Safety Project is to develop
      a theoretical foundation for safety and a methodology for building
      safety-critical systems built upon that foundation.  
      In <A href = "http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/safety/www/book.html"> <i>Safeware: System Safety and
      Computers</i></a>, Nancy Leveson summarizes the issues involved and
      lays the foundation for the methodology.  We are now working on safety 
      analysis techniques to support the methodology and a set of
      prototype tools to be used to validate the specification and analysis 
      techniques. <p>
