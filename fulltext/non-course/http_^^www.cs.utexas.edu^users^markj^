This semester I am the TA for CS372 Operating Systems, taught by
Richard Brice (TTH 8-9:30 a.m. TAY 2.106).

<p>

In addition, I am the TA for an Object Oriented Design and Analysis
class taught by Glenn Downing for the IBM/Apple Somerset Company.
Please see the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/markj/somerset.html"> WEB</a> page for this class.

<p>

I will be graduating with a Ph.D. in Computer Science this Spring.
After that, I will be working for the IBM/Motorola/Apple Somerset
Design Center<br>

<h2>Research Information</h2>

I am a member of the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/"> OOPS Research Group</a> in 
the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/markj//"> Department of Computer Sciences</a> at 
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas at Austin</a>.
<p>

As part of my Ph.D. research, I am building a real-time garbage
collector for C and C++.  In addition, I am performing a number of
studies on memory allocation routines.  A postscript copy of my <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/markj/proposal.ps"> dissertation
proposal (641K)</a> is available.

<p>

For more information, please see my <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/markj/papers.html">list
of publications</a> (along with brief descriptions). <p>

<p> 

I have developed a C++ class library that allows for the very precise timing
of routines on an Intel(tm) Pentium running Linux.  This code is
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/markj/zentimer.html"> publicly available.</a>
