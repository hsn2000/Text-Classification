<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

Fault-tolerant hard-real-time systems, system architecture,

<h2>Summary of Research</h2>

I am currently conducting fundamental research in the area of
distributed real-time systems. My primary concerns include
specification techniques for real-time systems, algorithms for
guaranteeing stringent timing constraints and understanding the
trade-off between the robustness and response times of time-critical
systems. The goal is to develop a formal framework for automating the
analysis and synthesis of robust real-time systems. Application areas
include robot control systems, avionics software and industrial
process control systems. Funding is being provided by the Office of
Naval Research to develop a highly automated design environment for
real-time systems. <p>
