I'm a graduate student in the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu">
computer science department</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/">
University of Washington</a>. 
I'm currently on academic leave from UW and working as a research scientist
at <a href="http://www.bellcore.com"> Bellcore</a> in Morristown, NJ.

<STRONG>At Bellcore:</STRONG> <br>
I'm interested in distributed computing issues - distributed OO systems,
application/system development, high availability. I currently work with 
the distributed systems group in Bellcore on high availability in distributed
software systems. [Very simply, a highly available system is one that 
continues to run in the presence of failures.] Our group is developing a 
toolset, <em>Anatidae</em>, that provides high availability mechanisms for 
distributed applications that adhere to the <em>CORBA</em> standard. <br>
We have also looked at active replication schemes for high availability in
<em>DCE</em> applications. A recent effort has focussed on enhancing the 
availability and fault tolerance of the Cell Directory Service (<em>CDS</em>)
of <em>DCE</em>. <br>
Details about these projects can be found
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mootaz/ftp/html/anatidae.html">
here</a>. <br>
I'm also interested in high availability issues for the Web and integration
of distributed OO technology with Web servers. <p></p>

<STRONG>At UW:</STRONG> <br>
At the University of Washington, I worked on the <I>Murphy</I> project 
(software safety methodologies) with the software safety group headed by
<a HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/leveson.html">
Dr. Nancy Leveson</a>. Details on safety research at UW can be found at the 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/safety/www">
UW safety page</a>. Much of my work involved looking into automatic fault 
tree generation from
requirements specifications written in RSML, as well as working on the 
RSML language simulator. <p></p>

<STRONG>Publications:</STRONG> <br>
A list of some recent publications can be found <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vivek/pubs.html"> here</a>.

  <TD> <p>

I was born and brought up in <a href="http://spiderman.bu.edu/misc/india/">
India</a>, but have been in the US for the last eight years. As an 
undergraduate, I attended <a href="http://www.angelo.edu">
Angelo State University</a> (San Angelo, TX), and then, 
<a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu">Wesleyan University</a> 
(Middletown, CT), where I received a B.A. in Physics and 
Math(Computer Science). Right after, I came to the University of Washington 
in Seattle to puruse graduate studies in Computer Science.
<br><br>

I like to play tennis whenever I can. Squash, and to a lesser
extent racquetball, suffice when I can't. I ardently folow the game of 
cricket. I've been participating in 
<a href=http://diana.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ta/uc_home.html"> Ultra Cricket</a>, 
a play-by-email cricket simulation game, for many years. I also follow the 
exploits of the Supersonics, the Mariners, and the Cowboys.
<br><br>

Over the last year and a half, I have taken a keen interest in 
learning ballroom dancing - the Waltz, Foxtrot, ChaCha, Rhumba, Tango, 
and Swing (no West Coast please), and some occasional dabbles in Mambo. 
The NY/NJ area has some of the best places for learning and dancing. The 
Seattle Center used to have a big-band session every Saturday. 
<br><br>

At UW, I was involved with the Model United Nations (MUN) chapter. 
Model United Nations (MUN) is an international, educational organization 
which simulates the workings of the UN. Conferences are held throughout 
the year on current topics - restructuring and reforming parts of the 
UN like the Security Council, ECOSOC, the IMF and the World Bank, rapid
population growth, nuclear proliferation, etc. 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vivek/MUN/"> Here</a> is the home page for the MUN chapter 
of UW.<br><br>

My other interests are in reading the poetry of Mirza Ghalib, a 19th century
Indian poet. I'm also interested in English literature, especially the 
Romantic and Victorian periods.
