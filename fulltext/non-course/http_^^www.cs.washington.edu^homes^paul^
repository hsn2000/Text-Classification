<p>I'm currently a graduate student at <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/">Univ. of Washington</A>, in
the Department of <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/paul/me//">Computer Science</A> (officially CSE).  My
office is <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ortega/431/431.html">431 Sieg</A>.  I'm working with the <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/www/rapid/">RaPiD Project</A>.</p>
<p>I used to say that I was a first-year student, but during the
summer after my second year, someone expressed concern about
this characterization.</p>
<p>Where am I?  I'm usually somewhere in <A HREF="http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com/map/db=usa/features=alltypes/ht=0.15/wd=0.10/iht=200/iwd=200/lat=47.67/lon=-122.32/proj=sine">North Seattle</A>, where I
live and go to school.</p>

of these days, I'll get around to scanning in some better ones.

<h2>Where did I come from?</h2>
<p>I got my high-school diploma from Live Oak High School in
Morgan Hill, CA, where I was taught Prolog for the first time.
I graduated in <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</A> from
<A HREF="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</A>, where I was taught Prolog for the second time.  (And
yes, I was taught Prolog once more at UW.  I'm just glad I
didn't use it during my year at the University of Bergen.)  I
also did research for a professor in the Electrical and
<A HREF="http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/">Computer Engineering</A> department.</p>
<h2>Fun Stuff</h2>

<p>While I was at UC Davis, my partners in various CS-related
activities tended to be <EM>Matt</EM>, <EM>Chris</EM>, and <A HREF="http://db.stanford.edu/~jedavis/home.html">James</A>.  (We even
got together recently, using Chris's marriage to Joanne as an
excuse; Chris's brother also made it
in the photo.)</p>

<p>Throughout my undergraduate years, I kept biking more and more,
but never very far (Davis isn't that big, and it's flat).
During my year as an exchange student to the University of
Bergen, I biked hillier and longer routes, so when I returned
to Davis, I took up rollerblading, since biking around town was
now too easy.</p>
<p>My biking dropped off during the year I worked at Hewlett
Packard, but it returned with a vengeance when I moved to
Seattle.  I've done the annual Seattle-to-Portland bike ride in
two days; I may do it in one some year.  But that's only in
season (March/April-June).  The rest of the year, I just
commute by bike and do lots of <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mfisher/dancing.html">dancing</A>, particularly Lindy
Hop.</p>
