<h3> On voting </h3>

<P>
Millions of sensible people are too high-minded to concede that
politics is almost always the choice of the lesser evil.  "Tweedledum
and Tweedledee," they say, "I will not vote."  Having abstained, they
are presented with a President who appoints the people who are going to
rummage around in their lives for the next four years.  Consider all
the people who sat home in a stew in 1968 rather than vote for Hubert
Humphrey.  They showed Humphrey.  Those people who taught Hubert
Humphrey a lesson will still be enjoying the Nixon Supreme Court when
Tricia and Julie begin to find silver threads among the gold and the
black.

<h3> On commitment </h3>

<P>
	Until a man is committed there is hesitancy, the chance
	to draw back, always ineffectiveness.  Concerning all
	acts of initiative there is one elemental truth the
	ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans:
	That the moment a man definitely commits himself, then
	Providence moves too.  All sorts of things occur to 
	help him that would never otherwise have occurred.  
	A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising
	in his favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and 
	meetings and material assistance and magic which he could
	not have dreamed would have come his way.  Whatever you can
	do or dream you can, begin it now.<P>
