<h2> Personal </h2>

Yeah right, like I'd put anything personal here.  Okay, maybe a 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ddion/personal/personal.html"> little</a>.

<h2> Academics </h2>

<b> Current Research: </b> 
For the past year I have been working with 
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bershad/">Brian Bershad</a>.
My primary responsibility is the construction of a UNIX server for the
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www">SPIN</a>
operating system.  SPIN is an operating system on which applications 
can achieve impressive performance by dynamically extending the kernel.  
Safety and protection are maintained at the language level, as SPIN and 
its extensions are written in  
<a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html">
Modula-3</a>.

<p>

The user-level SPIN UNIX server is a slight variant of a DEC OSF/1 Unix 
server, which thinks it is running on Mach.  SPIN dynamically linked 
extensions are used to intercept OSF/1 system calls and to emulate a 
Mach kernel environment.

<p>

<b>Previous Research: </b> SPIN is not the first extensible system I have
worked on.  In my <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ddion/jwz/prev_research/research.html">undergraduate 
studies</a> at <a href="http://www.nd.edu">Notre Dame</a> I helped 
implement user-level memory management for an extensible communications 
subsystem.

<h2> Web Stuff </h2>

I'm afraid I don't have the time to sit around and surf the Web,
so I wouldn't claim to know about all the cool stuff out there.  I
promise to do more surfing as soon as I have Netscape-enhanced
this page (don't hold your breath).  Meanwhile, these are some of the 
sites I visit occasionally for work and for distraction.
