Welcome to my home page ! 
<!-- The time here in Austin is <a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/xbmclock.xbm?zone=CST/"><img src="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/nph-usnoclock.gif?zone=CST&ticks=04/" align=absbottom alt="US Naval Observatory Clock"></a>  -->

I am a Ph.D. student in candidacy in the <a

<h1>Research</h1>

 <IMG SRC="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/images/stanford/simp.nerd.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=LEFT>My dissertation is on <b>Powerlists</b>, a functional notation for describing
synchronous parallel algorithms. In this work I study how the notation can
be mapped efficiently onto different parallel architectures, including
hypercubes and meshes. My advisor is <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/misra/index.html">Jayadev Misra</a>, who invented the powerlist
notation and heads the <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/psp/welcome.html">PSP group</a> here at
UT. For more information about my research see my <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kornerup/kornerup-papers.html"> list of papers</a>.

<h2>My Hotlist</h2>

Some frequently-used or interesting WWW nodes I've run across:

<ul>

<li><b> PSP group:</b>

    To make our work available the PSP group (Dr. Misra, Will Adams, Al
    Carruth, Markus Kaltenbach and me) has created a  <a
href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/psp/"> home page</a>. PSP
    stands for <b> Programs, Specifications and Proofs </b>
<p>
<li><b>Formal Methods</b>
    One of my professional goals is to promote the use of formal methods by
introducing them early on in the undergraduate curriculum. A good place to
learn more about this is the <a
href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/archive/formal-methods.html">
Formal Methods</a> home page at Oxford. 
<p>
Some very good arguments for using formal methods can be made after reading the
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kornerup/ariane5rep.html">ARIANE 5 Flight 501 Failure Report</a> or
looking at <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kornerup/quotes.html">my page of quotes that support
the use of formal methods.</a>
<p>
<li><b>The Computer Science Departments Home Page</b>
Our department has a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/">home page</a> with
access to web pages for students, staff and faculty. It also has access to
<a href="http://wwwhost.cc.utexas.edu/">The University's web server</a>.
<p>
<li><b>CS Tech Reports & Bibliographies:</b>
<!--
    The <a href="http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/harvest/">The Harvest
    Information Discovery and Access System</a> is an information server
    utilizing "information brokers" one of which is <a
    href="http://rd.cs.colorado.edu/brokers/cstech/query.html">Query
Interface to the CS Technical Report Broker</a>, giving access to a large
collection of CS technical reports. --> 

For access to a collection of technical reports have a look at <a
href="http://lucy.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~nzdl/">The New Zealand Digital
Library.</a>
<p>
<a href="http://wheat.uwaterloo.ca/bibliography/index.html">The
Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies</a> is a comprehensive
collection of bibliographies in computer science. Hey, I even have <a
href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/nborisov/getquery.cgi?IN=Any&QUERY=jacob&WHERE=Anywhere&OP1=AND&QUERY2=kornerup&WHERE2=Anywhere&OP2=AND&QUERY3=&WHERE3=Anywhere&SEARCH=SEARCH">entries</a>
there :-)
<p>
<li><B>Volleyball info:</b>

Look at <a href="http://Market.NET/~vball">Volleyball WorldWide</a> for
useful info about a great sport. You used to be able go over to Gregory
Gym, here on the UT campus, where you could find pictures of the mostly CS
Grad/Law/faculty/staff intermural champs of 91, 92 and 95, and runners-up
of 93 and 94 <b> High Voltage Spikes</b> and <b>Last Minute</b>.

<h1>A Great Day for the First Amendment</h1>


<b>News flash</b> (June 11 1996): The indecency provision in the newly passed Telecommunication
Bill has been ruled unconstitutional by a three member panel of federal
judges. For details see the EFF's <A
HREF="http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html">blue ribbon campaign.</a> 
<p>
On February 8, 1996 the Telecommunication Bill was signed into law,
making it criminal to transmit indecent material over the net. This means
that our freedom of speech was limited to what does not offend anyone
in Round Rock, TX or Salt Lake City, UT.
<br>
Please support the <A
href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</A> and other
organizations in their fight against this law.  You can support this
effort by including the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kornerup/rotate_rib.gif">blue ribbon</a> on your page.
