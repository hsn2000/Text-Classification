<H3><A NAME="Objective">Objective:</A></H3>

The objective of the Paradise project is to design, implement, and
evaluate a scalable, parallel geographic information system that is
capable of storing and manipulating massive data sets. By applying
object-oriented and parallel database technologies to the problem of
storing and manipulating geographic information we hope to
significantly advance the size and complexity of GIS data sets that
can be successfully stored, browsed, and queried.


<HR> <H3> <A NAME="Client Server Paradise">Client Server Paradise:</A></H3> 
Paradise is a database
system aimed at handling GIS types of applications.  Paradise provides
a graphical user interface for querying and browsing the database and
supports a subset of SQL for issuing ad-hoc queries.  Paradise
provides an extended-relational data model for modeling GIS
applications.  In addition to support for the base data types such as
integer, real, and string, Paradise has built-in support for raster,
polygon, polyline, point, circle, and video (mpeg images) data.
Paradise uses SHORE as its underlying persistent object manager.

<P>
The Paradise front end allows you to display objects with spatial
attributes on a 2-D map.  The map provides a layered display for
overlapping spatial attributes.  Each layer corresponds to one query.
You can customize the ordering and display of the layers by selecting
color, labelling, and other display attributes for each query.

<P>
The database can be queried either with a graphical interface or with
ad-hoc queries.  The graphical interface can be be used to issue
implicit spatial queries by zooming, clicking, and sketching a
rubber-banded box.  For ad-hoc queries, Paradise provides a query
composer.  Menus in the query composer provide access to the database
schema to assist in query composition.  Query results can either be
viewed on the 2-D map, if they have spatial attributes, or they can be
displayed in a table so that you can browse the tuples in the result.
The front end also provides context-sensitive help.

<P>
Paradise supports a subset of SQL for issuing ad-hoc queries.  To SQL
we have added the ability to invoke methods defined on the extended
set of types.  For example, you can calculate the area of a polygon by
using the method polygon.area().  Paradise also supports the standard
database operations including create and drop database, create and
drop extent, create and drop indices, insert, and update.

<P>
The current version of Paradise employs a client-server architecture.
The front-end ships queries in our SQL syntax to the Paradise
server for execution.  After executing the query, the server ships the
result objects back to the client.  The Paradise server is
multi-threaded so that multiple clients can connect to the same
server.  In designing and implementing the Paradise sever, careful
attention was paid to insure that the system could efficiently process
queries (especially those involving spatial attributes) on large
volumes of data.
