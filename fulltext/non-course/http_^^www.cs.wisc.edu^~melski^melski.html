<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~melski/michelle">Michelle</A> is an awesome person.  Her page is currently under construction.
My sister <A HREF="http://www.oberlin.edu/~kmelski">Kasey</A> has a 
great home page, as does my brother <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jmelski/">Eric</A>.

This semester I'm teaching a couple of sections of <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~melski/cs302.html">cs302</A>.
I'm also working with <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~reps/">Tom Reps</A> in programming languages.  My
exact schedule still needs to be determined.
<P>
As an undergrad, I majored in Computer Science and Russian Studies
here at the University of Wisconsin.  I even spent the fall semester
of '92 in Russia.  I don't get a chance to use my Russian very often,
and I miss it a bit.  Someday, someday, I'll make it back.
<P>
My other interests include chess and soccer.  Recently, I've been
biking a bit, too.  I've also been distracted from work by numerous
books, and hasty rewrites of my web page.
<P>
Here are my <Applet code=bookmarks.class height=40 width=90>
</applet>.  I also want to put a link to
<A HREF="http://www.mapquest.com/">mapquest</A>.  I plan on stealing a
lot of their maps in a second to give <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~melski/directions.html">directions</A> from Madison to Marshfield.
