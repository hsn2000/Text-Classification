Well, here I am.  The <em>other</em> UW.  This WWW page is just a copy
of my <a href="http://www.undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca/~cskaplan/">other home
page</a> at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.
When I have some more time, I'll modify this page to be more appropriate to
my current situation.

<p>
One enjoyable experience I had near the end of being an undergraduate
was the grad ball.  Here are some <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/csk/hp_grad.html">photos</a> from
the ball.
<p>
That second enjoyable experience occured Saturday, May 25th, 1996.  I 
addressed the convocation as valedictorian.  I cannot express how honoured 
I felt that such a wonderful graduating class should choose to have me 
represent them in this way.  Incidentally, for those of you who didn't know, 
my parents found out I was valedictorian about ten minutes before the start 
of the ceremony.  My mom says she'll never forgive me.  
<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/csk/vale.html">text</a> of my valedictorian address can be found here,
for anyone who's curious.
