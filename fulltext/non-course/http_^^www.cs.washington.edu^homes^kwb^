<dt>    The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for
   a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its
   home for life.  For this task it has a rudimentary nervous system.
   When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain any 
   more so it eats it.  It's rather like getting tenure.

<h3> Research </h3>

I'm currently working on building a high-speed, low-latency
LAN from Chaotic Routers (see below).  My previous research
has been on <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/chaos/www/chaos.html">Chaotic
Routing</a>, which is a form of non-minimal adaptive routing for
massively parallel multicomputers.

<h3> About me </h3>

<h4> Professional </h4> 

I am an assistant professor of electrical engineering at <a href=http://www.spu.edu>
Seattle Pacific University</a>.  I'm also working part time as a research
associate at the University of
Washington.  All significant papers I've written are in the <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/chaos/www/papers.html"> archives </a> of
the Chaotic Routing group.
<p>
I spend most of my time <a href=http://www.spu.edu/~bolding>
teaching</a> Electrical and Computer Engineering
at <a href=http://www.spu.edu>Seattle Pacific University</a>.

<h4> Personal </h4> 

Here are some photos I took of the <a href=http://paul.spu.edu/~bolding/comet.html>comet
Hyakutake</a> from Seattle.

No, the moustache isn't real.

In case you want to visit me at home, here is a <a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kwb/homemap.gif>map</a>.

I have another <a href=http://paul.spu.edu/~bolding>home page</a>
