<h3> Current Work</h3>
In my spare time I am a third year graduate student here at
the <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/general/overview.html">UW</a>.
I'm interested in
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/www/ai.html">AI</a>
and planning, but I've gotten into user interfaces and maybe even graphics
as well. I'm currently studying Knowledge Representation, goal-directed
behavior, mixed-initiative planning, activity recognition, and buzzword
acquisition in the context of human-computer interaction.<p>

Some of my recent work has been to prototype useful/intelligent interfaces for Bob
Doorenbos' <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bobd/shopbot-e.html">ShopBot</a>.
Rather than try to build our own interface, our plan is to somehow
integrate with the interfaces of various on-line stores by building a
"Shopping Assistant." One simple assistant we've built is a Mac application
that automatically reads and parses shopping baskets in order to determine
what products the user is interested in.<p>

I have also collaborated with Sean Anderson, Li-Wei He, Dan Weld,
David Salesin, and Michael Cohen to develop a simple interactive movie
that demonstrates automatic camera planning.<p>

As an Apple Intern, I worked with Dan Russell to mix planning technology
into the Mac user experience.<p>

I am also a co-developer/perpetrator of PDB, a graphical debugger for the
UCPOP family of planners(I'm not just a programmer...I'm also a client).
The number of people whose lives it has touched grows each and every day.
The manual is
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/www/pdb/pdb.html">here</a>.
<p>

I spent my undergraduate career at the
<a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>,
carboloading at Harold's Chicken and assisting in the
<a href="http://cs-www.uchicago.edu/~firby/aap/">Animate Agent Lab</a>.<p>

<h4>Where to Find Dave(when not at the IMA)</h4>
